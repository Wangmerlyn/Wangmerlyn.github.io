This paragraph references a source for the first time.[^first] Scroll a bit more to see how the sidebar follows.

Add another section with a second reference farther down.[^second] The goal is to visually check that the right-rail footnotes line up with the first footnote marker, and that the table of contents stays hidden.

[^first]: First sidebar footnote to check alignment.
[^second]: Second sidebar footnote; confirms list formatting and spacing.
